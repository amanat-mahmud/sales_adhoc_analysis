## ‚ùì Problem Statement
While the e-commerce platform shows strong revenue growth and a positive average customer rating, there are disparities in performance across product categories, regions, and order statuses. The high average order value of cancelled orders suggests potential issues with order fulfillment or customer expectations. Additionally, the imbalance between the number of sellers and customers indicates a need for marketplace expansion and diversification.

## üéØ Objective
The primary objective is to capitalize on the platform's revenue growth while addressing key areas for improvement. This includes optimizing product category performance, enhancing order fulfillment processes, expanding the seller base, and leveraging regional insights to drive growth. The goal is to increase overall revenue, reduce cancellations, improve seller-to-customer ratio, and maintain high customer satisfaction across all regions and product categories.
